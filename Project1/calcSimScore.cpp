    This double function takes in two inputs and then immediatly runs them against a series of if statments. The first one checks to see
    if the sequences are of different lengths, if they are the function returns 0 as no further calculations can be done, the second 
    statement checks to see if the sequences both have a length of 0, as this would again cause a calculation error, if this fires, 
    the function will again return a 0. Finally if both inputs are the same length and aren't at length 0, a for loop is fired that in
    essence, goes through both string inputs, and compares them at each character using subsrtrings, if they don't have a match, it adds
    to hamming distance by one for each mismatch. Then finally it runs the calculation for calculating sim score, and the function outputs
    the solution for said calculation.
